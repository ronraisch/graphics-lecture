# graphics-lecture
I'm making a one hour lecture about computer graphics.
All the material in this repostiry is meant for teaching the basic subjects
about computer graphics and animation.
The projects will be written in the Processing environment and p5.js environment.
Most of the stuff shown are a continuation or expansion of the projects made by
Daniel Shiffman at his youtube channel "Coding train".
